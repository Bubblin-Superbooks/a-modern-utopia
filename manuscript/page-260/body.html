Into such islands of exile as this a modern Utopia will have to purge itself.

The permanent idleness of a human being is not only burthensome to the world, but his own secure misery. But unprofitable occupation is also intended by idleness, and it may be considered whether that freedom also will be open to the Utopian. Conceivably it will, like privacy, locomotion, and almost all the freedoms of life, and on the same termsâ€”if he possess the money to pay for it.</p></div> </div>
