<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I had already discussed the question of race with the botanist at Lucerne.</p><p>“But you would not like,” he cried in horror, “your daughter to marry a Chinaman or a negro?”</p><p>“Of course,” said I, “when you say Chinaman, you think of a creature with a pigtail, long nails, and insanitary habits, and when you say negro you think of a filthy-headed, black creature in an old hat. You do this because your imagination is too feeble to disentangle the inherent qualities of a thing from its habitual associations.”</p><p>“Insult isn't argument,” said the botanist.</p><p>“Neither is unsound implication. You make a question of race into a question of unequal cultures. You would not like your daughter to marry the sort of negro who steals hens, but then you would also not like your daughter to marry a pure English hunchback with a squint, or a drunken cab tout of Norman blood.</p></div> </div>
