He has heard of me, he wants to see me and he gives me clear directions how to come to him.</p><p>I wonder if my own voice sounds like that.</p><p>“Yes,” I say, “then I will come as soon as we have been to our hotel.”</p><p>We indulge in no eloquence upon this remarkable occasion. Yet I feel an unusual emotional stir. I tremble greatly, and the telephonic mouthpiece rattles as I replace it.</p><p>And thence the botanist and I walk on to the apartments that have been set aside for us, and into which the poor little rolls of the property that has accumulated about us in Utopia, our earthly raiment, and a change of linen and the like, have already been delivered.</p></div> </div>
