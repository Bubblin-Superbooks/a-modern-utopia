<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In barbaric and disorderly countries it is almost honourable to be indigent and unquestionably virtuous to give to a beggar, and even in the more or less civilised societies of earth, so many children come into life hopelessly handicapped, that austerity to the poor is regarded as the meanest of mean virtues. But in Utopia everyone will have had an education and a certain minimum of nutrition and training; everyone will be insured against ill-health and accidents; there will be the most efficient organisation for balancing the pressure of employment and the presence of disengaged labour, and so to be moneyless will be clear evidence of unworthiness. In Utopia, no one will dream of giving to a casual beggar, and no one will dream of begging.</p><p>There will need to be, in the place of the British casual wards, simple but comfortable inns with a low tariffâ€”controlled to a certain extent no doubt, and even in some cases maintained, by the State.</p></div> </div>
