An officious little bell will presently call our attention to a label “London” on the doorway, and an excellent phonograph will enforce that notice with infinite civility. The doors will open, and we shall walk through into an equally comfortable gallery.</p><p>“Where is the train for London?” we shall ask a uniformed fellow Utopian.</p><p>“This is the train for London,” he will say.</p><p>There will be a shutting of doors, and the botanist and I, trying not to feel too childish, will walk exploring through the capacious train.</p></div> </div>
