Your double will be back to-morrow. Wait for him. Perhaps then you will understand―”</p><p>He shakes his head, and then bursts out with, “What do I want with a double? Double! What do I care if things have been different here? This―”</p><p>He thrusts me weakly back with his long, white hand. “My God!” he says almost forcibly, “what nonsense all this is! All these dreams! All Utopias! There she is―! Oh, but I have dreamt of her! And now―”</p><p>A sob catches him. I am really frightened by this time. I still try to keep between him and these Utopians, and to hide his gestures from them.</p></div> </div>
