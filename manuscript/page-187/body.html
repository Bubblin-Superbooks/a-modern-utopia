<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The room has no corners to gather dirt, wall meets floor with a gentle curve, and the apartment could be swept out effectually by a few strokes of a mechanical sweeper. The door frames and window frames are of metal, rounded and impervious to draught. You are politely requested to turn a handle at the foot of your bed before leaving the room, and forthwith the frame turns up into a vertical position, and the bedclothes hang airing. You stand at the doorway and realise that there remains not a minute's work for anyone to do. Memories of the f≈ìtid disorder of many an earthly bedroom after a night's use float across your mind.</p><p>And you must not imagine this dustless, spotless, sweet apartment as anything but beautiful.</p></div> </div>
