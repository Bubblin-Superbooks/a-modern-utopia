<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> “which do you value most, the wide world of humanity, or this evil trend in you?” From that discipline at last the prisoners will return.</p><p>But the others; what would a saner world do with them?</p><p>Our world is still vindictive, but the all-reaching State of Utopia will have the strength that begets mercy. Quietly the outcast will go from among his fellow men. There will be no drumming of him out of the ranks, no tearing off of epaulettes, no smiting in the face. The thing must be just public enough to obviate secret tyrannies, and that is all.</p><p>There would be no killing, no lethal chambers. No doubt Utopia will kill all deformed and monstrous and evilly diseased births, but for the rest, the State will hold itself accountable for their being. There is no justice in Nature perhaps, but the idea of justice must be sacred in any good society.</p></div> </div>
