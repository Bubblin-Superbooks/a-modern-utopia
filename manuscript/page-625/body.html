<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The crossing of Bow Street gives me pause again.</p><p>The face of a girl who is passing westward, a student girl, rather carelessly dressed, her books in a carrying-strap, comes across my field of vision. The westward sun of London glows upon her face. She has eyes that dream, surely no sensuous nor personal dream.</p><p>After all, after all, dispersed, hidden, disorganised, undiscovered, unsuspected even by themselves, the samurai of Utopia are in this world, the motives that are developed and organised there stir dumbly here and stifle in ten thousand futile hearts....</p><p>I overtake the botanist, who got ahead at the crossing by the advantage of a dust-cart.</p></div> </div>
