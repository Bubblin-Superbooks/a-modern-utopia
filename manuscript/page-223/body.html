<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We find ourselves confronted with a book, a little after the fashion of the familiar hotel visitors' book of earth. He places this before us, and beside it puts pen and ink and a slab, upon which ink has been freshly smeared.</p><p>“Thumbmarks,” says my scientific friend hastily in English.</p><p>“You show me how to do it,” I say as quickly.</p><p>He signs first, and I look over his shoulder.</p><p>He is displaying more readiness than I should have expected. The book is ruled in broad transverse lines, and has a space for a name, for a number, and a thumbmark. He puts his thumb upon the slab and makes the thumbmark first with the utmost deliberation. Meanwhile he studies the other two entries. The “numbers” of the previous guests above are complex muddles of letters and figures. He writes his name, then with a calm assurance writes down his number, A.M.a.1607.2.αβ⊕.</p></div> </div>
