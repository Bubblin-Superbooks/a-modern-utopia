<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What is there to prevent a parallel movement of all the civilised Powers in the world towards a common ideal and assimilation?</p><p>Stupidityâ€”nothing but stupidity, a stupid brute jealousy, aimless and unjustifiable.</p><p>The coarser conceptions of aggregation are at hand, the hostile, jealous patriotisms, the blare of trumpets and the pride of fools; they serve the daily need though they lead towards disaster. The real and the immediate has us in its grip, the accidental personal thing. The little effort of thought, the brief sustained effort of will, is too much for the contemporary mind. Such treaties, such sympathetic international movements, are but dream stuff yet on earth, though Utopia has realised them long since and already passed them by.</p></div> </div>
